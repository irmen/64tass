.SH NAME
64tass \- A multi pass optimizing macro assembler for the 65xx series of processors
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B 64tass
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fISOURCES\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
64tass is cross assembler targeting the 65xx series of micro processors. This manual is
only describing the command line options. The many features are described in the HTML manual.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp 1
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-o\fR \fIfilename\fR
Place output into \fIfilename\fR. The default output filename is "a.out",
this option changes it.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-nostart\fR
Output data only without start address.
Overlapping blocks are flattened and uninitialized memory is filled up
with zeros. Uninitialized memory before the first and after the last
valid bytes are not saved. Useful for small ROM files.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-flat\fR
Flat address space output mode.
Overlapping blocks are flattened and uninitialized memory is filled up
with zeros. Uninitialized memory after the last valid byte is not saved.
Useful for creating huge multi bank ROM files (over 64K). See sections
for an example.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-nonlinear\fR
Generate nonlinear output file.
Overlapping blocks are flattened. Blocks are saved in sorted order
and uninitialized memory is skipped.
Used for linkers.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-X\fR, \fB\-\-long\-address\fR
Use 3 byte address/length for CBM and nonlinear output instead of 2 bytes.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-\-atari\-xex\fR
Generate a Atari XEX output file.
Overlapping blocks are kept, continuing blocks are concatenated. Saving
happens in the definition order without sorting, and uninitialized memory
is skipped in the output.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-\-apple2\fR
Generate a Apple II output file (DOS 3.3).
Overlapping blocks are flattened and uninitialized memory is filled up
with zeros. Uninitialized memory before the first and after the last
valid bytes are not saved.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-ascii\fR
Use ASCII/Unicode text encoding instead of raw 8-bit.
Normally no conversion takes place, this is for backwards compatibility with a
DOS based Turbo Assembler editor, which could create PETSCII files for
6502tass. (including control characters of course)
Using this option will change the default "none" and "screen" encodings to map
\'a\'\-\'z\' and \'A\'\-\'Z\' into the correct PETSCII range of $41\-$5A and $C1\-$DA,
which is more suitable for an ASCII editor. It also adds predefined petcat
style PETSCII literals to the default encodings, and enables Unicode letters in symbol names.
For writing sources in UTF-8/UTF-16 encodings this option is required!
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-long\-branch\fR
Automatic BXX *+5 JMP xxx. Branch too long messages can be annoying sometimes,
usually they'll need to be rewritten to BXX *+5 JMP xxx. 64tass can do this
automatically if this option is used. But BRA is not converted.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-case\-sensitive\fR
Case sensitive labels. Labels are not case sensitive by default, this
option changes that.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-D\fR \fIlabel\fR=\fIvalue\fR
Defines a \fIlabel\fR to a \fIvalue\fR. Same syntax is
allowed as in source files. Be careful with string quoting, the shell
might eat some of the characters.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-no\-warn\fR
Suppress warnings. Disables warnings during compile.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-\-no\-caret\-diag\fR
Suppress displaying of faulty source line and fault position after fault
messages.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Suppress messages. Disables header and summary messages.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-tasm\-compatible\fR
Enable TASM compatible operators and precedence
Switches the expression evaluator into compatibility mode. This enables
".", ":" and "!" operators and disables 64tass specific extensions,
disables precedence handling and forces 16 bit unsigned evaluation (see
"differences to original Turbo Assembler" below)
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-I\fR \fIpath\fR
Specify include search \fIpath\fR.
If an included source or binary file can't be found in the directory of
the source file then this path is tried. More than one directories can be
specified by repeating this option. If multiple matches exist the first
one is used.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-\-m65xx\fR
Standard 65xx (default). For writing compatible code, no extra codes.
This is the default.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-m65c02\fR
CMOS 65C02. Enables extra opcodes and addressing modes specific to this CPU.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-m65ce02\fR
CSG 65CE02. Enables extra opcodes and addressing modes specific to this CPU.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-m6502\fR
NMOS 65xx. Enables extra illegal opcodes. Useful for demo coding for C64, disk drive code, etc.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-m65dtv02\fR
65DTV02. Enables extra opcodes specific to DTV.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-m65816\fR
W65C816. Enables extra opcodes, and full 16 MiB address space. Useful for SuperCPU projects.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-m65el02\fR
65EL02. Enables extra opcodes, useful RedPower CPU projects. Probably you'll need "\-\-nostart" as well.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-\-mr65c02\fR
R65C02. Enables extra opcodes and addressing modes specific to this CPU.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-\-mw65c02\fR
W65C02. Enables extra opcodes and addressing modes specific to this CPU.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-l\fR \fIfile\fR, \fR\-\-labels\fR=\fIfile\fR
List labels into \fIfile\fR. List global used labels to a file.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-\-vice\-labels\fR
List labels in a VICE readable format.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-L\fR \fIfile\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR=\fIfile\fR
List into \fIfile\fR. Dumps source code and compiled code into file. Useful for
debugging, it's much easier to identify the code in memory within the
source files.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-no\-monitor\fR
Don't put monitor code into listing. There won't be any monitor listing
in the list file.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-no\-source\fR
Don't put source code into listing. There won't be any source listing in
the list file.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-\-tab\-size\fR=\fInumber\fR
By default the listing file is using a tab size of 8 to align the
disassembly. This can be changed to other more favorable values like 4.
Only spaces are used if 1 is selected. Please note that this has no
effect on the source code on the right hand side.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Give this help list. Prints help about command line options.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Give a short usage message. Prints short help about command line options.
.TP 0.5i
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print program version.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
Normally the exit status is 0 if no error occured.
